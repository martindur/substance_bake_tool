A GUI tool for batch baking using the Substance Engine from Allegorithmic

![substance-bake-tool-0.1](https://i.imgur.com/uiPLZ0f.png)

## Description

The tool is meant to be an easy and quick way to bake multiple files from folders and output to e.g. a designated project directory. It is, more than anything, a pipeline tool.

**The tool is brand new, and with limited features and usability. I want to know whether this tool is useful for other productions, as well as potential suggestions on how to improve it for even more efficient usage.**

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Substance Automation Toolkit

## Usage

1. Open a console e.g. Terminal(Mac) or Powershell(Win)
2. Go to the *Substance Bake Tool* directory

```
cd find/the/right/dir/substance_bake_tool
```

3. Run the *bakerGUI.py* script.

```
python3 bakerGUI.py
```
4. Copy/Paste your *mesh input* path and *texture output* path. As well as locate the sbsbaker.exe(for win) or just sbsbaker(Mac/Linux)

5. Bake your stuff!
